// We are going to use Termbox to create a program with Text-based User
// Interface (TUI).
import Termbox

// A TUI program uses your terminal (simulator) as a canvas and draws characters
// on it. Combined with user inputs, we can create applications similar those
// with a GUI.
// A terminal can display a fixed number of characters horizontally and
// vertically. Each character, in addition to its glyph, can have a foreground
// color, a background color, among other things.
//
// Let's see how that works with a function that prints a line of text:
/// - Parameters:
///   - x:          x location of the text.
///   - y:          y location of the text.
///   - text:       what does the text say.
///   - foreground: what attributes should the text have for its foreground.
///   - background: what attributes should the text have for its background.
func printAt(x: Int32, y: Int32, text: String,
    foreground: Attributes = .default, background: Attributes = .default)
{
    // We can get the terminal's height and width like this:
    let border = Termbox.width

    // We can update characters on the screen one at a time with, each with a
    // distinct style. Here we are going to start at `x` and set characters in
    // `text` until we run out of horizontal space in row `y`.
    for (c, xi) in zip(text.unicodeScalars, x ..< border) {
        Termbox.put(x: xi, y: y, character: c, foreground: foreground,
            background: background)
    }
}

// There's more demo of the similar ideas as in `printAt` in this next function.
/// Draw a bar at the bottom to display help messages.
func updateHelp(drawing: UnicodeScalar) {
    let lastY = Termbox.height - 1
    let content = [
        "Drawing [\(drawing)]",
